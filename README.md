## Capstone Project: Detection of Bus Number in Bus Panel

### Details
Name: Wenna Loo Yan Ying

Class: DSIF-SG-1

## Problem Statement
Mobility and orientation are the biggest challenges for people with visual impairments. This includes walking, taking public transportation, or even getting a ride on buses. Developing assistive technologies to help them navigate outdoor environments could potentially improve their quality of life. Since public transportation, such as buses, is a main tool for people with visual impairments to navigate outdoor, this project aims to create a proof of concept (POC) that can help people with visual impairment to determine if itâ€™s the right bus they need through Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for the text on the bus.


## Executive Summary
To assist visually impaired passengers to travel more independently, a POC have been created to detect and recognize bus number of public buses arriving at a bus stop in Singapore. The design made use of a combination of Object Detection (using YOLOv5) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR), to extract bus number from bus panel and convert the extracted text for audio notification.

Starting with data acquisition, we downloaded YouTube videos of public buses arriving at a bus stop in Singapore.
