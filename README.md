## Capstone Project: Detection of Bus Number in Bus Panel

### Details
Name: Wenna Loo Yan Ying

Class: DSIF-SG-1

## Problem Statement
Mobility and orientation are the biggest challenges for people with visual impairments. This includes walking, taking public transportation, or even getting a ride on buses. Developing assistive technologies to help them navigate outdoor environments could potentially improve their quality of life. Since public transportation, such as buses, is a main tool for people with visual impairments to navigate outdoor, this project aims to create a proof of concept (POC) that can help people with visual impairment to determine if itâ€™s the right bus they need through Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for the text on the bus.
